# Reflection Notes

## Documentation
Could probably go through the codebase and add some more comments and descriptions.

## Testing
More testing needs to be done. Especially around checking state after useEffect runs in some components. Also need to test the async functions that interact with the API. 

## Features
It would be really beneficial to have some sort of caching layer. Maybe IndexedDB?

It would be really nice to have an auto-complete feature and partial search feature for the search bar. Might need to use a different API for that, though.
