# Okera React Coding Exercise
The goal of this exercise is to let you show us what you can do with Javascript and React. We'll be asking you to spend some time writing a simple application that demonstrates your abilities to build a usable interface, write view code, and interact with an existing API. The result will be an application that we can review, build and run and the code will serve as a discussion point for any upcoming interviews.

## Details
You will be building a Game of Thrones "Houses and Characters Explorer" using a public api that exposes information about them from books and TV. Familiarity with (or favorable opinion of) Game of Thrones is not required. All you need to know is that there are a number of noble houses, each of which has sworn members. We'd like you to build an app that lets a user explore details about the houses and the characters that belong to them. The details of the UX are up to you, but your app should include:

* A paginated list of characters with buttons to move between pages
* A way to see details about each character, including which house they belong to or are sworn to
* The ability to find characters by name

Again, the details of presentation are up to you. We are looking for something usable, but design abilities are not the point--focus on clear code.

We'd like to see some unit tests for the components you write. That said, we aren't looking for high test coverage for this exercise, just an understanding of how to unit test Javascript code, especially for critical code-paths. A few examples of good unit tests will suffice.

### API

For details on the API, see: https://anapioficeandfire.com/

No API key is required and the rate limits should be more than sufficient for this task.

### App setup
Your app should be written using React. We strongly suggest using Create React App to set up your app skeleton and dev server, but if you have another way you'd rather structure things, thats ok, but be sure to tell us how to run it. 

Docs on CRA are here: https://create-react-app.dev/

The result should be a zipped file that we can unpack and try. You don't need to include npm modules in the package.

### How much time should you spend?
Spend about 3 hours on this project. If you'd like to spend more time making it more interesting, you are welcome to, but the goal is not to see how fancy you can make things. We'll be happy to see what you have after 3 hours. 

### Can you use other libraries?
Sure, bring in whatever libraries you want. Feel free to rely on your past work as well.

### Does it need to run in IE?
No. Don't worry about browser compat. If your app works in a modern evergreen browser, that's all we ask. 

## Completion
When you are done, zip your app and send it to marshall@okera.com.
